	Hur Makes Leap in the Rankings
	Sunday, Mi Jung Hur returned to the winner’s circle for the first time in five years with her victory at the Aberdeen Standard Investments Ladies Scottish Open. With her victory, she jumped 36 spots in the Rolex Rankings, moving from 79 to 43 in the world. Over the last five years, Hur has taken a ride up and down the rankings. In August 2017, she climbed to a career high No. 15 in the world as she recorded one of her most consistent seasons on Tour with six top 10s. But Hur didn’t record a single top 10 in 2018 and dropped as low as No. 121 in the world before rebounding in 2019 with two top 10s and a victory through the first eight months of the year.
